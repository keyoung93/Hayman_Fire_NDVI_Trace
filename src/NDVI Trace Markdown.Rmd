## Hayman Fire

2002 Large fire in central Colorado. Analysis is how fire alterted vegetation

### Data Read 
First we need to read in the data

```{r data read in}
#Reading in the data. 
ndvi <- read_csv('data/hayman_ndvi.csv') %>%
  rename(burned=2,unburned=3) %>%
  filter(!is.na(burned),
         !is.na(unburned))
```

## Tidying

Next we clean up the data

```{r Tidying}
# Converting from wide to long data (One column for burned & unburned)
ndvi_long <- gather(ndvi,
                    key='site',
                    value='NDVI',
                    -DateTime)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
